# Here is the completion of the TODO in the python code

```python
with open('./prototypes/prototype_prototype_README.md_ln14.py_ln24.py', 'r') as file:
    lines = file.readlines()
    for line in lines:
        if '@TODO' in line:
            print(line)
```

This script will open the file in read mode, read all lines into a list, and then iterate over each line. If '@TODO' is found in a line, it will print that line.
